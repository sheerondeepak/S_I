Purpose: This is "Mission Control." It provides a user-friendly, visual interface to monitor the firewall's activity in real-time. It allows a human operator to see what the AI is doing, what threats it's blocking, and the overall health of the network traffic.
Contents:
app.py: A web server backend built with a framework like Flask or FastAPI. It reads the log file generated by the live firewall and serves that data to the frontend.
templates/: Contains the HTML files that define the structure of the web pages.
static/: Holds the CSS for styling and the JavaScript for creating dynamic, real-time charts and graphs (e.g., using Chart.js or D3.js).
Role: This provides visibility and monitoring. It makes the project accessible and impressive, turning a command-line tool into a complete application.
